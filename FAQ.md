This document lists Frequently Asked Questions about Personal Diary.

## Usage

- **How do I set, change or remove my passcode?**

    Go to Personal Diary and click on the Settings icon. Locate "Set or Change App Passcode..." and tap on that.

    If you intend to remove a passcode, simply press 'Done' without typing anything when you're prompted with 'Enter a New Passcode'.

- **How do I change the mood, date and weather for a selected entry?**

    Tap on the mood, date and weather text near the top of the screen while viewing an entry.

- **How do I disable auto mood detection and auto weather selection?**

    You may find the relevant settings at Personal Diary \> Settings \> Artificial Intelligence. The options only prevent the automatic selection of mood and weather, but does not remove them.

    If you are instead looking for disabling the mood and weather options, see the below question.

- **How do I disable or hide the mood and weather options entirely?**

    Go to Personal Diary \> Settings \> "No Mood and Weather by Default" and turn it on.

    This will configure all new diary entries to have _no_ mood and weather information. You can still override this on a per-entry basis, and old entries will not be modified by this change.

- **How do I sync my diary data between all my Apple devices?**

    Simply make sure all your devices are signed in to the same Apple ID and have iCloud Drive turned on, and you're good to go!

    You can check your Apple ID info by going to the Settings app or System Preferences and locating your name, then tap on it.

    You can also verify that iCloud Drive is enabled for Personal Diary by going into Personal Diary \> Settings \> iCloud Drive and making sure it's on.

    If you're having problems, check the issues section below.

## Issues

- **I am experiencing a weird glitch within the app or that the app isn't responding. What should I do?**

    Try the following troubleshooting steps ([iOS, iPadOS, watchOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201398), [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201276)).

    Next, please report the issue via Personal Diary \> Settings \> App Support, or Recovery Mode (if you are prompted), so as it can be resolved. You should also check if there is any available updates on the App Store, and if so update the app to the latest release.

- **I forgot my passcode. Is there a way to reset it?**

    Yes, you can attempt to do so via Recovery Mode. However, your configuration (system settings or app settings) may disallow you from doing so. 
    
    When performing a passcode reset, the app will run some checks to verify your identity based on historical activity, and if it fails to do so, it will not allow you to proceed.

    _Note that the passcode reset tool does not guarantee a successful passcode reset, so do remember your passcode well or your data may be permanently inaccessible._

- **I've successfully performed a passcode reset but I am still prompted with a passcode. What do I do or type?**

    You should be notified that your passcode has been reset to the default, which is either `0000` or `1234` depending on the version you're using. Try those codes and they should take you right in.

    You may change that afterwards via the "Set or Change App Passcode..." option in Personal Diary settings.

- **My data is not syncing between my Apple devices even though my settings are correct. How do I resolve that?**

    Please try restarting your device. 
    - On iOS or iPadOS, [follow the instructions based on your device here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201559).
    - On macOS, click the Apple logo located at the top left of the menu bar, and then click Restart.

    Next, make sure you're connected to the Internet (ideally a Wi-Fi connection). Open the app on all your devices. You can perform a pull down to refresh in the Timeline to force an iCloud update.

- **My diary data has disappeared/I have received an "Error Loading Data" alert. What should I do to restore my data?**

    This is usually because your data is in iCloud but inaccessible.

    First, try restarting your device. 
    - On iOS or iPadOS, [follow the instructions based on your device here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201559).
    - On macOS, click the Apple logo located at the top left of the menu bar, and then click Restart.

    Next, make sure the following switches are turned on:
    - Settings app/System Preferences \> \[Your Name\] \> iCloud \> iCloud Drive
    - Settings app/System Preferences \> \[Your Name\] \> iCloud \> Personal Diary
    - Personal Diary app \> Settings \> iCloud Drive.

    If you're connected to an Internet connection (ideally on Wi-Fi), your data should automatically download from iCloud Drive in a moment.

- **My diary data, specifically date information, appears to be corrupted. Can this be resolved?**

    This tends to be an issue when restoring from an iOS/iPadOS/iCloud backup, migrating to a different device or upgrading iOS/iPadOS, as the OS tampers with the date information the app uses.
    
    If you have been using Personal Diary version 2.5 or later frequently and have been updating to the latest releases, simply waiting for a moment for your diary data to download will automatically resolve the issue. You can force this to occur by performing a "pull down to refresh". This is because the date information displayed may not be the actual data stored by the app.
