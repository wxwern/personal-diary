## Description

Personal Diary is a simple and easy to use journalling app which is completely free with no advertisements and limitations. Easily access all your entries in all your devices with iCloud Sync. With passcode & biometric protection, you can write diary entries without worrying that someone will peek at what you wrote. Forgot about your diary? The app will now 'summon' you back a friendly nudge. You can also import as many photos as you wish into your entries. As an addition, you can optionally set your mood and the current weather.
